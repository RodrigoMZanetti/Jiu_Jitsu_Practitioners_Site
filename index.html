    <h2>1. Creatine Monohydrate</h2>

    <p>BJJ is full of explosive moments — bridging, passing, escaping. Creatine increases your short-burst power. You’ll notice stronger takedowns, quicker scrambles, and less fatigue But it’s not just about strength. Studies show creatine also helps with brain performance, including reaction time and memory — both huge in Jiu-Jitsu, where mental fatigue is real.</p>
    <p>Research shows creatine improves strength, muscular endurance, and lean mass. Even better? It's safe. Decades of studies show no serious health risks in healthy individuals.</p>
